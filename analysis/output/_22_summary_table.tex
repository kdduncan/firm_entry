\multicolumn{6}{l}{All variables are for the difference between our subject and neighbor counties. At the state level, this is 1177 observations. Further, all tax variables are scaled to be between 0 and 100 rather than 0 and 1. For each variable we observe them 13,115 times when not accounting for positive or negative infinify values in firm start up rates.} \\
