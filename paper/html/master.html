<!--l. 4--><p class="noindent" >PLACEHOLDER, TO BE WRITTEN
<!--l. 6--><p class="indent" >   This paper tests whether or not taxes impact firm entry rates. This topic has been
constantly examined by economists over the years. One of the major unanswered questions is
accounting for joint changes in tax policy when estimating these impacts. Traditionally
researchers have only estimated a few taxes at once, while the levers of policy actions extend
across a large array of tax rates. Comparably we include property, income, corporate, capital
gains, sales, workers compensation, and unemployment insurance top marginal tax
rates.
<!--l. 8--><p class="indent" >   The paper proceeds in the following manner. First, we review literature relating to
estimating the determinants of firm entry. We then provide a model to show how utilizing
discontinuities along state borders allow researchers to control for location specific determinants
of firm entry. Next, we explain our empirical design, which uses matched county
pairs on either side of state borders to identify the effects on taxes on firm start up
rates. We then provide estimates of these impacts. We conclude by showing which
borders have the largest firm start up discrepancy, and talk about applications of our
work.

<!--l. 4--><p class="noindent" >Location choice of firms and individuals has a rich history in economics. At its core, the
question is what drives households and firms to choose to locate in particular communities.
                                                                                      
                                                                                      
Tiebout (1956) argued that individuals sorted into locations based on their preferences for
prices and public amenities. He posited that, because households can &#8220;vote with their
feet,&#8221; counties have incentives to adjust their provision of services in order to attract
residents.<span class="footnote-mark"><a 
href="master2.html#fn1x0"><sup class="textsuperscript">1</sup></a></span><a 
 id="x1-2001f1"></a> 
<!--l. 6--><p class="indent" >   Guided by Tiebout&#8217;s model, the early firm entry literature focused on sorting over all
available possible markets. McFadden (1974) provided a general framework for using the
conditional Logit function to estimate firm entry choices over all available possible markets.
Early papers such as Carlton (1979, 1983) and Schmenner (1975, 1982) failed to find incidence
of taxes on firm entry rates, instead finding that higher taxes could attract more firms. Starting
in the 80&#8217;s methods and data allowed for cleaner identification, such that authors
started to more definitively show that taxes had an impact on business activity,
including Wasylenko &amp; McGuire (1985), Bartick (1985), Papke (1991), and Hines
(1996).
<!--l. 8--><p class="indent" >   Researchers have continued to estimate models of firms sorting over a large number of
counties. Gabe and Bell (2004) used Poisson and Negative Binomial regressions show how taxes
and government spending on education impact firm location in Maine. Their results show that
increasing tax rates to raise education spending per pupil causes no distortion on firm entry
rates. A review of these sort of sorting estimates was done by Arauzo-Carod et al (2010). In
their review they show that agglomeration and market size tend to have a significant positive
effect, while wages and taxes act in the opposite direction. Further, the findings on the effect
                                                                                      
                                                                                      
of property values as is implied in the traditional Tiebout models is even weaker
(see Dowding, John, and Biggs (1994) for a comprehensive review of Tiebout model
estimates).
<!--l. 10--><p class="indent" >   Increasingly researchers have utilized border-difference technique to establish
local estimates of the impacts of taxes on firm entry rates. This method controls
for endogeneity of government policy in response to local economic outcomes. For
example, high economic activity states may raise their taxes knowing that local
agglomeration factors will continue to attract an asymmetrically high amount of new
firm start ups, while low economic activity states may lower taxes to attract new
businesses.<span class="footnote-mark"><a 
href="master3.html#fn2x0"><sup class="textsuperscript">2</sup></a></span><a 
 id="x1-2002f2"></a> 
This response would upwards-bias the estimate of the impacts of taxes. Using the differences in
firm entry rates along state borders controls for local agglomeration factors, and treat
differences in policy variables as exogenous.
<!--l. 12--><p class="indent" >   This technique relies on the assumption that new firms pick entry locations within a local
choice set. Recent studies on agglomeration economies seem to support this view. Rosenthal
and Strange (2003, 2005), and Arzaghi and Henderson (2008)) show that entrepreneurs weight
potential locations within a mile of their current location significantly higher than distances
                                                                                      
                                                                                      
further away. Use of border discontinuity designs started with Holmes&#8217; (1998) analysis of right
to work laws on manufacturing employment growth. In Holmes&#8217; paper, he uses right to work
status as a proxy for an unobserved cost of being on either side of a state border imposed by
&#8221;pro&#8221; and &#8221;anti&#8221; business policies. He then tested whether or not right to work status affected
manufacturing employment growth. His estimates found that counties that have right to
work status attract more manufacturing firms than states without right to work
status.
<!--l. 14--><p class="indent" >   Since Holms&#8217;s study, this technique has been adopted by researchers looking to
identify effects of additional state policies, including minimum wages (Dube et al, 2008;
Rohlin, 2011), welfare (McKinnish, 2005; 2007), and school quality (Dhar and Ross,
2012). Recent papers looking at the impacts of taxes on firm start up rates, including
Rathelot and Sillard (2008), Duranton et al (2011), and Rohlin, Rosenthal, and Ross
(2014).
<!--l. 16--><p class="indent" >   Rohlin (2011) looked at the impact of minimum wages on firm start up rates using
aggregated data. By utilizing the Dun and Bradstreet Marketplace data files Rohlin
constructed bands around state borders, and then derived estimates on the impact of minimum
wage changes on firm start up rates. He showed that increasing the minimum wage decreased
new establishment activity in industries that relied heavily on minimum wage workers,
but that changes in the minimum wage did not decrease employment in existing
establishments.
<!--l. 18--><p class="indent" >   Chirinko and Wilson (2008) use a border discontinuity technique to estimate the impact of
state investment tax credits on firm start up rates. Rathelot and Sillard (2008) use the
border discontinuity technique in a Probit model to show that increasing the total
tax rate differential increases the probability of a firm picking a side between 1-5%.
                                                                                      
                                                                                      
Duranton, et al (2011) difference firm entry rates in neighboring areas to estimate the
impact of taxes on employment. While their traditional OLS estimates (without
the spatial difference) show a positive relationship between taxes and firm entry
rates, after applying the spatial difference, taxes negatively impact firm start up
rates.
<!--l. 20--><p class="indent" >   A recent paper by Rohlin, Ross, and Rosenthal (2014) mirrors our paper very closely. They
estimate a linear probability model of firm entry using a border difference estimator. They use
GIS coded data to get a closer bandwidth to the border than our method, and show that
increasing the personal income tax differential actually increases the likelihood of
firms entering on one side of the border. However, they show that increasing the
corporate and sales tax differential can drastically reduce the relative firm entry
probability.
<!--l. 22--><p class="indent" >   Rohlin et al utilize a measure of state-level government expenditures per capita, and utilize
Tax Foundation data on top marginal sales, corporate, and personal income tax rates
from 2000 to 2003. They estimate a linear probability model of the chance that a
firm enters onto one side of the border. They then use reciprocal agreements on
where individuals pay income taxes based on location of work rather than location of
residence to try to control for proper allocation of tax burdens on each side of the
state, and to provide additional strength in identification. Finally, they then use zip
code level data to estimate average entry along each side of the border. Both with
and without the reciprocal agreements in place, they show that there is a negative
impact of increasing the tax differential between states on the probability of firm
entry.
<!--l. 24--><p class="indent" >   Our paper differs by having a considerably larger number of tax policy variables, thus better
                                                                                      
                                                                                      
controlling for other tax policies that may be impact business activity. Moreover, we also
include a longer time series than Rohlin et al, providing additional variation in state level tax
policies over our window. We differ in only having county level data, rather than the finer zip
code level data that Rohlin et al use. This provides a much finer bandwidth to identify the
impacts of changes on.
<!--l. 26--><p class="indent" >   A major issue with the existing literature is the failure to settle on the best variables to use
for identifying the effects of taxes on firm start up rates. Carlton (1983) used top marginal tax
rates for corporate and income tax, but weighted them together, as well as property tax rates.
Schmenner (1987) uses state and local property tax revenues per dollar of personal
income. Helms (1985) used a budget constraint to estimate the impacts of rising tax
revenue on explanatory variables. All three versions have modern equivalents and the
literature has not settled on a single best practice to recover the proper marginal
effects.
<!--l. 28--><p class="indent" >   Theory indicates that marginal tax rates are what matter to individuals, and measures of
average tax burden change due to both fluctuations in wages or profits, as well as
to changes in tax rates. Using average tax rates may add endogeneity into models.
Also, politicians may alter multiple taxes at once in order to accomplish policy goals,
such that excluding taxes may imply omitted variable bias. Therefore, we argue that
using top marginal tax rates is the preferred method of estimating marginal effects of
taxes.
<!--l. 30--><p class="indent" >   From the literature, we see that on average taxes negatively impact firm start up rates,
especially as researchers have gone from studying sorting over all available entry choices, to
local choices along policy discontinuities. However, how taxes are calculated and used in
studies differs wildly among authors. Various studies have used measures of average
                                                                                      
                                                                                      
tax revenue, added together top marginal tax rates, or included a single available
tax rate. As a result, we employ more recent spatial difference techniques to get a
clear estimate, while employing a larger array of top marginal tax rates than other
authors.

 id="x1-30003"></a>Theory</h3>
<!--l. 3--><p class="noindent" >As entrepreneurs and firms look to start up a business in a new location they first choose a
market to enter. This choice is due to primary considerations such as labor market
characteristics, or location preferences of the owner. They then pick among possible locations
within that market. Our model looks at choice of firm entry across state borders, such that
individuals have mobility across the border. As a result, firms treat location specific
determinants of profit as the same on both sides of the border. This process leaves policy
drivers as the only remaining difference in expected profits. We formalize the conditions for this
process below.
<!--l. 5--><p class="indent" >   Assume there exists a spatial equilibrium where wages and capital costs adjust to equalize
profits across space, conditional on local tax and location specific variables affecting firm level
productivity. If markets are competitive, firms will earn zero economic profits in the long run,
but in the short run, demand or policy shocks can result in short run profits (or losses). We
expect that if a state raises its taxes relative to its neighbors, higher relative production costs
and lower relative profits will exist for counties in that state. Firms looking to locate in that
market will, all else equal, choose the lower cost side of the border. The higher relative taxes
rates will deter firms from entering. Over time, entry on the lower tax side of the border
will bid up prices until after-tax prices, and profits, equalize on either side of the
                                                                                      
                                                                                      
state border. Prices can be proxied by the tax rates directly. Firms make decisions
based on information from the previous year, as governments might concurrently
change policy along with market entry and there may exist costs to establishing a
business.

than interior towns, and high tax states will set lower taxes on the border than the
interior. The logic here is to mitigate, or not exacerbate, the border differential as
much as possible from both sides of the border, but that this reduction occurs only

taxes, this should downwards bias our estimates, as the actual discontinuity is less

address this concern, we use clustered standard errors on the state pair grouping. This method

estimates. States that are divided by the river, but not along borders far away from the
river.
<!--l. 61--><p class="indent" >   A possible concern with our specification is that states may change taxes in response to the
difference in firm entry rates. This would introduce endogeneity in the model. However, due to
the stability of our policy parameters, it seems unlikely that governments are responding to
firm startup rates. Furthermore, it is unlikely that states set statewide policy based on the
subset of border counties that we include in our model.

<!--l. 3--><p class="noindent" >Our main results are reported in Table (<a 
href="#x1-220074">4<!--tex4ht:ref: --rd --></a>). The first four columns report the pooled OLS
estimates with and without our sets of additional control variables. The last two columns
report our fixed effect estimates. Higher relative income taxes and sales taxes deter firm entry.
This result is robust to the addition of controls, and in fact, the estimated effects become
slightly stronger (more negative) with the added measures.
<!--l. 5--><p class="indent" >   While statistically significant the effects are economically small. A 1 percent increase in
income tax differentials correspond to a 0.8 percent decrease in the relative firm start up rates,
                                                                                      
                                                                                      
and similarly a 1 percent increase in sales tax differentials corresponds to a 0.1 percent decrease
in the relative firm start up rates. Higher relative property tax rates also exert a negative
influence on firm births, although this effect becomes statistically insignificant when amenity
measures are included in the model. While capital gains, corporate tax, workers compensation,
and unemployment insurance tax rates are individually insignificant, the set of seven tax rates
are jointly significant.
<!--l. 7--><p class="indent" >   Of the three expenditure measures included in the model, only the difference in log welfare
spending per capita is statistically significant. The coefficient is economically very small,
such that a 1% increase in the difference corresponds to 0.001% higher firm entry
rates.
<!--l. 9--><p class="indent" >   When we run models with state-pair level fixed effects we fail to obtain any statistically
significant results. However, the value of these models are dubious. We first argue that our
pooled OLS estimates are most likely the properly specified model as firm start up rates are an
already differenced estimate. Thus the inclusion of state pair fixed effect require year to year
divergence in expected profit from entry, which shouldn&#8217;t occur under perfect competition.
Rather this still might imply that there are still relevant variables we may be leaving out of our
model.
<!--l. 11--><p class="indent" >   Table <a 
href="#x1-220096">6<!--tex4ht:ref: --eb --></a> reports the estimates for the extended bandwidth version of our model. We expect
that the increased distance between the two locations, and the increased distance from the
border, will diminish the impact taxes have on firm start up rates. Meanwhile we would expect
the measures of state and local factors to have a larger impact. Our results are consistent with
these expectations. The income and sales tax rates lose statistical significance across model
types. Further, our state level controls remain largely insignificant, as do our geographic
controls. Thus, the fit of the model at large seems to decrease as the distance between counties

are of equal magnitude and opposite sign. The exceptions are sales tax rates and
workers compensation tax rates. For the subject county sales taxes are strongly and
negatively significant, but for the neighbor they are insignificant. However, given
that the rest of them pass, this might be a spurious result due to the number of
regressors. We see an equivalent note in the workers compensation figures in our F tests,
where for the neighboring county it appears to be significant, but not for the subject
county.<span class="footnote-mark"><a

Hover, given the rest of taxes pass this test, this finding might be a spurious result due to the
number of regressors.
<!--l. 15--><p class="indent" >   Table <a 
href="#x1-2201411">11<!--tex4ht:ref: --year --></a> shows regression results for each year between 1999 and 2009. We include state
controls but exclude geographic amenities. Property taxes remain consistently negative and
statistically significant over the time period. Likewise, sales tax rates remain negative
and statistically significant, with the effect becoming somewhat larger over time.
                                                                                      
                                                                                      
Income taxes are insignificant, but negative, at the beginning of the time period,
but become statistically significant and larger in the later years. Log highway and
welfare expenditures per capita are positive drivers of firm entry, but the effects
are inconsistently significant across the time periods and the magnitudes are very
small.
<!--l. 17--><p class="indent" >   Finally, Table <a 
href="#x1-2201512">12<!--tex4ht:ref: naics --></a> reports the estimates by NAICS sub codes, Agriculture, Fishing, Forestry,
and Hunting; Retail Trade; Manufacturing; and Finance and Insurance. These results are very
consistent with the results for all firms in Table <a 
href="#x1-220074">4<!--tex4ht:ref: --rd --></a>. Property, income and sales taxes are
significantly negative in all specifications, and furthermore, the magnitudes are very
similar across the industries. Driving this effect is probably due to the relatively large
size of counties, giving space for many different types of firms to open up. Further,
services may make up the bulk of this cross-industry firm opening. However, our
hypothesis would be to expect higher property taxes to have a larger detrimental effect on
agriculture services, and capital gains taxes to have a higher impact on financial firm
entry.
<!--l. 19--><p class="indent" >   Table <a 
href="#x1-220129">9<!--tex4ht:ref: --metro --></a> provides an alternative look at this effect. We see that as we widen and narrow
our definition of urban, that capital gains remains positive and significant, while
income and sales taxes remain negative and significant. Comparably, in rural areas,
property taxes remain negative and significant, and seem to solely drive the firm
entry differential, to the point where the joint F-tests are rejected across all model
specifications. This property tax differential is explained in the literature by firms
moving to rural areas to take advantage of low property values and lower wages for
work.
<!--l. 21--><p class="indent" >   As a final output of our paper, we compare two different rankings to identify which borders
                                                                                      
                                                                                      
are most (or least) disadvantaged with regard to tax differentials. First we calculate the
weighted tax differential by multiplying the tax coefficients from Table <a 
href="#x1-220074">4<!--tex4ht:ref: --rd --></a>, column 4 by each
states marginal tax values. This generates an expected value is in the ratio of firm start up
rates driven by the tax differentials. These are plotted in Figure <a 
href="#x1-220008">8<!--tex4ht:ref: weightedtax --></a>. For most states the weighted
tax differential is very small, thus the implied impact of taxes on relative firm start up rates is
ultimately small. However, for a few counties, this is not the case, and we see clear outliers
where more than a 1% difference in firm start up rates is motivated by the difference in tax
rates.
<!--l. 23--><p class="indent" >   To illustrate how important this effect is for firm entry we rank the county-pairs by the
absolute difference in the mean number of firm startups, and compare this to the
weighted tax differential. Table <a 
href="#x1-2201916">16<!--tex4ht:ref: meantable --></a> reports the top 50 largest mean differences in firm
start-ups. Since we calculate these terms in absolute value, we report which side
of the border has the advantage for firm startups in column 2 and which has the
advantage in terms for tax rate differences in column 4. Sixty-two percent of the time,
the side with the more advantageous weighted tax differential also has the higher
mean firm start up differential. We similarly rank the top 10 states by Weighted Tax
Differential in <a 
href="#x1-2202017">17<!--tex4ht:ref: taxtable --></a>. Compared to weighting by mean firm start up rate, there is a
higher correlation between having a higher weighted tax differential and mean firm
startups.

 id="x1-200007"></a>Conclusion</h3>
<!--l. 3--><p class="noindent" >This paper estimates the average impact of taxes on firm start up rates. Using a model that
relies on the similarity of locations on either side of a state border, we are able to effectively
                                                                                      
                                                                                      
control for location-specific determinants of firm entry in our empirical design, and
more precisely isolate the effects of policy that do vary on opposite sides of a state
border.
<!--l. 5--><p class="indent" >   We find that counties with higher property, income, and sales taxes relative to a
neighboring county in another state, have lower firm start-up rates. On average, a 1% increase
in the property tax differential decreases firm start up rates by 0.3%, while a 1% increase in
income and sales tax differentials decreases firm start up rates by 0.01%. These results are
generally consistent across industry groups, and time periods in our sample. They are also
largely robust to the addition of added controls.
<!--l. 7--><p class="indent" >   Our estimated model&#8217;s inability to find significant corporate and capital gains taxes follows
from characteristics of new firm entrants. Lacking firm-level characteristics, our model
approximates an average firm from the joint distribution of firm characteristics. However, most
new firms are small S corporations, meaning that owners pay top marginal income taxes rather
than corporate taxes, and firm employment and output is relatively low. Sales, income,
and property taxes may play a significantly larger role on their profits than capital
gains and corporate tax rates. Moreover, most new firms have a relatively short life
span, such that investments in the company will probably not be recouped, and
that capital gains tax rates are not likely to impact the majority of small new firm
entrants.
<!--l. 9--><p class="indent" >   Government expenditure variables do not seem to impact firm start up rates. This might be
due to the fact that individuals can live in one county that has a preferred public expenditure
bundle and set up a businesses in a neighboring county that has a preferred regulatory
policy. Our robustness tests using Rohlin, Rosenthal, and Ross (2014) reciprocal
agreements mirror our main model and estimates, indicating that this impact is largely not
                                                                                      
                                                                                      
large.
<!--l. 11--><p class="indent" >   Based on our estimates, we calculate a weighted tax differential, showing that the impact of
taxes on firm entry rates remain small, only accounting for about 0.2% of the difference in firm
start up behavior across borders. Despite this, the side with the preferred taxation policy had
more firm startups 62% of the time in our sample. Therefore while taxes might have a small
impact at the margin, their adjustment may still be beneficial to communities and
states.
<!--l. 13--><p class="indent" >   Future work on this issue could benefit from more dis-aggregated, firm-level data with firm
specific characteristics. This would help establish better estimates of tax incidence on firm
startup and life cycle behavior. Our current estimates are limited by our set of covariates.
Lacking firm specific data, our estimates rely on a proxy &#8221;average firm&#8221;, which is most
likely small and not paying corporate taxes, nor have venture capital backing. Thus
taxes that may have impacts based on firm characteristics may be omitted from our
model.
