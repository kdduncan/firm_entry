<!--l. 58--><p class="noindent" >Taxes are a major lever that policy makers use to bring about change in communities, where
many attempt to either spur economic growth or raise revenue for new initiatives. Estimating
the impacts of taxes on economic activity provides large value to lawmakers looking to
understand and assess how and when to raise or lower taxes. For many states this impact is
doubly important as they are required to have balanced operating budgets at the end of each
fiscal year. Because of this, states cannot use deficit spending to make up for short
run slow losses in tax revenue, and are forced to navigate a careful balance between
promoting employment and wage growth while maintaining yearly revenue. Knowing
how tax policies impact economic activity provides policy makers more knowledge
on the real costs of implementing tax policy changes, particularly over short time
periods.
<!--l. 60--><p class="indent" >   One of the major ways in which taxes may impact economic activity is through deterring
new firm start ups. Firms provide new employment, capital, and innovation into economies,
while still bringing new tax revenue to state coffers. Many tax cuts are carried out under the
assumption that increased growth will quickly return government tax revenue back to their
original level, or, to those looking to raise taxes, that hikes will not have a large distortionary
effect on economic growth. Providing estimated values for the the impacts of taxes and
expenditures on firm entry might better allow State and Federal government&#8217;s the ability to
properly account for tax incidence.
<!--l. 62--><p class="indent" >   Accordingly this paper tests whether or not taxes impact firm entry rates. This topic has
been constantly examined by economists over the years. One of the major unanswered
questions is accounting for joint changes in tax policy when estimating these impacts.
                                                                                      
                                                                                      
Traditionally researchers have only estimated a few taxes at once, while the levers of policy
actions extend across a large array of tax rates. We add value to the literature by including the
longest array of top marginal tax rates used to date. This includes property, income, corporate,
capital gains, sales, workers compensation, and unemployment insurance top marginal tax
rates.
<!--l. 64--><p class="indent" >   These tax rates cover the vast majority of existing tax rates that state policy makers use.
Many governments may opt to change tax rates jointly. An example of a policy that would
cause such a joint movement may be lowering corporate taxes but keep revenue neutral by
raising income taxes. This allows us to both track changes in tax policy that alters state
expenditures as well as policy changes that are meant to change tax incidence. Much of the
existing literature includes a much smaller array of tax rates, which has the potential to create
omitted variable bias especially if governments attempt to hide the true burden of taxes by
shifting the tax incidence. Our longer array helps capture the full impact of these changes on
economic activity.
<!--l. 66--><p class="indent" >   The paper proceeds in the following manner. First, we provide a model to show how
utilizing discontinuities along state borders allow researchers to control for location specific
determinants of firm entry when the full location choice of firms may be unknown. Next, we
explore characteristics of state tax structure, relative firm entry, and frequency of
joint tax changes. Then we explain our empirical design, which uses matched county
pairs on either side of state borders to identify the effects on taxes on firm start up
rates.
<!--l. 68--><p class="indent" >   We provide estimates for how differences in state level tax and expenditures per
capita impact relative firm entry rates into counties on either side of the border.
This includes estimates for a sliding scale of estimates for matched urban and rural
                                                                                      
                                                                                      
communities, and year specific effects. We conclude by providing an estimate for how large
the aggregate impact of taxes is on relative firm entry along US states based both
on ranking by existing discrepancy in mean firm entry rates, and by the predicted
difference.
<!--l. 70--><p class="indent" >   The results of this paper aim to provide clear, well identified, estimates of the impacts of
top marginal tax rates on firm entry. This estimate may be of value to policy makers looking to
judge the efficacy of tax cuts or hikes on local economic activity and state tax revenue better
than existing estimates.

   <h3 class="sectionHead"><span class="titlemark">2   </span> <a 
 id="x1-20002"></a>Literature Review</h3>
<!--l. 74--><p class="noindent" >Location choice of firms and individuals has a rich history in economics. At its core, the
question is what drives households and firms to choose to locate in particular communities.
Tiebout (1956) argued that individuals sorted into locations based on their preferences for
prices and public amenities. He posited that, because households can &#8220;vote with their
feet,&#8221; counties have incentives to adjust their provision of services in order to attract
residents.<span class="footnote-mark"><a 
href="mscThesis_final2.html#fn1x0"><sup class="textsuperscript">1</sup></a></span><a 
 id="x1-2001f1"></a> 
<!--l. 76--><p class="indent" >   Guided by Tiebout&#8217;s model, the early firm entry literature focused on sorting over all
available possible markets. McFadden (1974) provided a general framework for using the
                                                                                      
                                                                                      
conditional Logit function to estimate firm entry choices over all available possible markets.
Early papers such as Carlton (1979, 1983) and Schmenner (1975, 1982) failed to find incidence
of taxes on firm entry rates, instead finding that higher taxes could attract more firms. Starting
in the 80&#8217;s methods and data allowed for cleaner identification, such that authors started
to more definitively show that taxes had a negative impact on business activity,
including Wasylenko &amp; McGuire (1985), Bartick (1985), Papke (1991), and Hines
(1996).
<!--l. 78--><p class="indent" >   Researchers have continued to estimate models of firms sorting over a large number of
counties. Gabe and Bell (2004) used Poisson and Negative Binomial regressions show how taxes
and government spending on education impact firm location in Maine. Their results show that
increasing tax rates to raise education spending per pupil causes no distortion on firm entry
rates. Arauzo-Carod et al (2010) provide a review of these sorting-type studies. They show that
agglomeration and market size tend to have a significant positive effect on firm entry rates,
while wages and taxes act in the opposite direction. Further, findings for a negative
effect of property values as implied in the traditional Tiebout models is even weaker
(see Dowding, John, and Biggs (1994) for a comprehensive review of Tiebout model
estimates).
<!--l. 80--><p class="indent" >   Increasingly researchers have utilized border-difference techniques to establish
local estimates of the impacts of taxes on firm entry rates. This method controls
for endogeneity of government policy in response to local economic outcomes. For
example, high economic activity states may raise their taxes knowing that local
agglomeration factors will continue to attract an asymmetrically high amount of new
firm start ups, while low economic activity states may lower taxes to attract new
                                                                                      
                                                                                      
businesses.<span class="footnote-mark"><a

 id="x1-2002f2"></a> 
This response would upwards-bias the estimate of the impacts of taxes. Using the differences in
firm entry rates along state borders controls for local agglomeration factors, and treats
differences in policy variables as exogenous.
<!--l. 82--><p class="indent" >   This technique relies on the assumption that new firms pick entry locations within a local
choice set. Recent studies on agglomeration economies seem to support this view. Rosenthal
and Strange (2003, 2005), and Arzaghi and Henderson (2008)) show that entrepreneurs weight
potential locations within a mile of their current location significantly higher than distances
further away. Use of border discontinuity designs started with Holmes&#8217; (1998) analysis of right
to work laws on manufacturing employment growth. In Holmes&#8217; paper, he used right to work
status as a proxy for an unobserved cost of being on either side of a state border imposed by
&#8220;pro&#8221; and &#8220;anti&#8221; business policies. He then tested whether or not right to work status affected
manufacturing employment growth. His estimates found that counties that have right to
work status attract more manufacturing firms than states without right to work
status.
<!--l. 84--><p class="indent" >   Since Holmes&#8217; study, this technique has been adopted by researchers looking to
                                                                                      
                                                                                      
identify effects of additional state policies, including minimum wages (Dube et al, 2008;
Rohlin, 2011), welfare (McKinnish, 2005; 2007), and school quality (Dhar and Ross,
2012). Recent papers looking at the impacts of taxes on firm start up rates, including
Rathelot and Sillard (2008), Duranton et al (2011), and Rohlin, Rosenthal, and Ross
(2014).
<!--l. 86--><p class="indent" >   Rohlin (2011) looked at the impact of minimum wages on firm start up rates using
aggregated data. Utilizing the Dun and Bradstreet Marketplace data files, Rohlin constructed
bands around state borders, and then derived estimates on the impact of minimum wage
changes on firm start up rates. He showed that increasing the minimum wage decreased new
establishment activity in industries that relied heavily on minimum wage workers,
but that changes in the minimum wage did not decrease employment in existing
establishments.
<!--l. 88--><p class="indent" >   Chirinko and Wilson (2008) use a border discontinuity technique to estimate the impact of
state investment tax credits on firm start up rates. Rathelot and Sillard (2008) use the
border discontinuity technique in a Probit model to show that increasing the total
tax rate differential increases the probability of a firm picking a side between 1-5%.
Duranton, et al (2011) difference firm entry rates in neighboring areas to estimate the
impact of taxes on employment. While their traditional OLS estimates (without
the spatial difference) show a positive relationship between taxes and firm entry
rates, after applying the spatial difference, taxes negatively impact firm start up
rates.
<!--l. 90--><p class="indent" >   A recent paper by Rohlin, Ross, and Rosenthal (2014) mirrors our paper very closely. They
estimate a linear probability model of firm entry using a border difference estimator. They use
GIS coded data to get a closer bandwidth to the border than our method, and show that
                                                                                      
                                                                                      
increasing the personal income tax differential actually increases the likelihood of
firms entering on one side of the border. However, they show that increasing the
corporate and sales tax differential can drastically reduce the relative firm entry
probability.
<!--l. 92--><p class="indent" >   They utilize a measure of state-level government expenditures per capita, and utilize Tax
Foundation data on top marginal sales, corporate, and personal income tax rates
from 2000 to 2003. They estimate a linear probability model of the chance that a
firm enters onto one side of the border. They then use reciprocal agreements on
where individuals pay income taxes based on location of work rather than location of
residence to try to control for proper allocation of tax burdens on each side of the
state, and to provide additional strength in identification. Finally, they then use zip
code level data to estimate average entry along each side of the border. Both with
and without the reciprocal agreements in place, they show that there is a negative
impact of increasing the tax differential between states on the probability of firm
entry.
<!--l. 94--><p class="indent" >   Our paper differs by having a considerably larger number of tax policy variables, thus better
controlling for other tax policies that may impact business activity. Moreover, we also include a
longer time series than Rohlin et al, providing additional variation in state level tax policies
over our window. We differ in only having county level data, rather than the finer zip code level
data that Rohlin et al use, and advantage of their study in that it provides a finer bandwidth in
which to identify impacts.
<!--l. 96--><p class="indent" >   A major issue with the existing literature is the failure to settle on the best variables to use
for identifying the effects of taxes on firm start up rates. Carlton (1983) used top marginal tax
rates for corporate and income tax, but weighted them together, as well as property tax rates.
                                                                                      
                                                                                      
Schmenner (1987) uses state and local property tax revenues per dollar of personal
income. Helms (1985) used a budget constraint to estimate the impacts of rising tax
revenue on explanatory variables. All three versions have modern equivalents and the
literature has not settled on a single best practice to recover the proper marginal
effects.
<!--l. 98--><p class="indent" >   Theory indicates that marginal tax rates are what matter to individuals, and measures of
average tax burden change due to both fluctuations in wages or profits, as well as
to changes in tax rates. Using average tax rates may add endogeneity into models.
Also, politicians may alter multiple taxes at once in order to accomplish policy goals,
such that excluding taxes may imply omitted variable bias. Therefore, we argue that
using top marginal tax rates is the preferred method of estimating marginal effects of
taxes.
<!--l. 100--><p class="indent" >   From the literature, we see that on average taxes negatively impact firm start up rates,
especially as researchers have gone from studying sorting over all available entry choices, to
local choices along policy discontinuities. However, how taxes are calculated and used in studies
differs wildly among authors. Various studies have used measures of average tax revenue, added
together top marginal tax rates, or included a single available tax rate. As a result, a
key contribution of this study is the use of more recent spatial difference techniques
combined with a larger array of top marginal tax rates that may affect firm entry
rates.

 id="x1-30003"></a>Theory</h3>
<!--l. 104--><p class="noindent" >As entrepreneurs and firms look to start up a business in a new location they first choose a
                                                                                      
                                                                                      
market to enter. This choice is due to primary considerations such as labor market
characteristics, or location preferences of the owner. They then pick among possible locations
within that market. Our model looks at choice of firm entry across state borders, such that
individuals have mobility across the border. As a result, firms treat location specific
determinants of profit as the same on both sides of the border. This process leaves policy
drivers as the only remaining difference in expected profits. We formalize the conditions for this
process below.
<!--l. 106--><p class="indent" >   Assume there exists a spatial equilibrium where wages and capital costs adjust to equalize
profits across space, conditional on local tax and location specific variables affecting firm level
productivity. If markets are competitive, firms will earn zero economic profits in the long run,
but in the short run, demand or policy shocks can result in short run profits (or losses). We
expect that if a state raises its taxes relative to its neighbors, higher relative production costs
and lower relative profits will exist for counties in that state. Firms looking to locate in that
market will, all else equal, choose the lower cost side of the border. The higher relative taxes
rates will deter firms from entering. Over time, entry on the lower tax side of the border
will bid up prices until after-tax prices, and profits, equalize on either side of the
state border. Prices can be proxied by the tax rates directly. Firms make decisions
based on information from the previous year, as governments might concurrently
change policy along with market entry and there may exist costs to establishing a
business.

<!--l. 144--><p class="noindent" >Our theory holds that as the location choice of firm entrants approaches a state border the
difference in location-specific attributes on either side of the border approaches zero. Thus, an
advantage of the border design is that these location-specific factors are differenced away in a

estimate a &#8220;closeness to the border&#8221; bandwidth at the county level. The average county in our
data set is 1,260 square miles, or about 35 miles per side if it is approximately square. This
distance is slightly longer than more refined approaches such as Rohlin, Rosenthal, and Ross

than interior towns, and high tax states will set lower taxes on the border than the interior.
The logic here is to mitigate, or not exacerbate, the border differential as much as possible from
both sides of the border, but this reduction occurs only gradually as you approach the

2008, income tax and capital gains tax rates exhibit strong positive correlation; the simple
correlation between values is 0.64. Sales, payroll, workers compensation, and unemployment
insurance tax rates are only weakly correlated with other tax rates. The presence of
simple correlations indicate that studies that do not include a larger array of taxes,
may suffer from omitted variable bias. Thus modeling firm entry using a larger set

<!--l. 211--><p class="indent" >   For each <span 
class="cmmi-12">i,g,t</span>-triplet there may be unobserved shocks to the state-pair border that affect all
counties along the border. For example, if the Mississippi river floods, counties that are divided
by the river will be affected, while counties on borders away from the river will not be. To
address this concern, we use clustered standard errors on the state pair grouping. This method
                                                                                      
                                                                                      
will not affect the estimated coefficients, but will adjust the standard errors of the estimates.
It can be shown that our estimate has the same point identification of estimators
that take the difference in border averages, but has a different variance-covariance
matrix.
<!--l. 213--><p class="indent" >   A possible concern with our specification is that states may change taxes in response to the
difference in firm entry rates. This would introduce endogeneity in the model. However, due to
the stability of our policy parameters, it seems unlikely that governments are responding to
firm startup rates. Furthermore, it is unlikely that states set statewide policy based on the
subset of border counties that we include in our model.
<!--l. 215--><p class="indent" >   Finally, we estimate a variety of different permutations of our baseline model. We split our
controls into two sets: county level geographic amenities and state level economic controls. We
estimate models that have no additional controls besides for tax and expenditure variables,
models that have only state or geographic amenities, and then a model that includes
both sets. The purpose is check whether the estimated coefficients on the tax and
expenditure variables become statistically insignificant once we account for these
additions.

are in Metropolitan Statistical Areas in general, and where both subject and neighbor counties
are in the same MSA. We then partition counties into areas where both are either urban or
rural. We use the ERS classification system to determine if a county is urban or rural, where a
county is defined as urban if its classification is 5 or below, and rural if its classification is 6 or
higher.<span class="footnote-mark"><a

<!--l. 251--><p class="indent" >   We further follow Rohlin, Rosenthal, and Ross (2015) by including comparisons between
states that have reciprocal agreements, and those without reciprocal agreements. Our original
samples might be biased, as a few states have reciprocal agreements, where individuals pay the
income tax rate of the state they work in rather than where they live. We split our sample
into states with and without reciprocal agreements, and estimate our model on each
sample.
   <h3 class="sectionHead"><span class="titlemark">6   </span> <a 
 id="x1-190006"></a>Results</h3>
<!--l. 254--><p class="noindent" >Our main results are reported in Table (<a 
href="#x1-220094">4<!--tex4ht:ref: --rd --></a>). The first four columns report the pooled OLS
estimates with and without our sets of additional control variables. The last two columns
report our fixed effect estimates. Higher relative income taxes and sales taxes deter firm entry.
This result is robust to the addition of controls, and in fact, the estimated effects become
slightly stronger (more negative) with the added measures.
<!--l. 256--><p class="indent" >   While statistically significant the effects are economically small. A 1 percent increase in
income tax differentials corresponds to a 0.8 percent decrease in the relative firm start up rates,
and similarly, a 1 percent increase in sales tax differentials corresponds to a 0.1 percent
                                                                                      
                                                                                      
decrease in the relative firm start up rates. Higher relative property tax rates also exert a
negative influence on firm births, although this effect becomes statistically insignificant when
amenity measures are included in the model. While capital gains, corporate tax, workers
compensation, and unemployment insurance tax rates are individually insignificant, the set of
seven tax rates are jointly significant.
<!--l. 258--><p class="indent" >   Of the three expenditure measures included in the model, only the difference in log welfare
spending per capita is statistically significant. The coefficient is economically very small,
such that a 1% increase in the difference corresponds to 0.001% higher firm entry
rates.
<!--l. 260--><p class="indent" >   When we run models with state-pair level fixed effects we fail to obtain any statistically
significant results. However, the value of these models are dubious. We argue that our pooled
OLS estimates are most likely the properly specified model as firm start up rates are an already
differenced estimate. Thus the inclusion of state pair fixed effect requires year to
year divergence in expected profit from entry, which shouldn&#8217;t occur under perfect
competition.
<!--l. 262--><p class="indent" >   Table <a 
href="#x1-220116">6<!--tex4ht:ref: --eb --></a> reports the estimates for the extended bandwidth version of our model. We expect
that the increased distance between the two locations, and the increased distance from the
border, will diminish the impact taxes have on firm start up rates. Meanwhile we would expect
the measures of state and local factors to have a larger impact. Our results are consistent with
these expectations. The income and sales tax rates lose statistical significance across model
types. Further, our state level controls remain largely insignificant, as do our geographic
controls. Thus, the fit of the model at large seems to decrease as the distance between counties
increases.
<!--l. 264--><p class="indent" >   When we relax the assumption that that coefficients are equal on either side of the border,
                                                                                      
                                                                                      
we find that for most of our variables, the effects remain equal but opposite across the border.

class="cmmi-8">i,nbr</span></sub>. The results verify our belief that the coefficients are of equal magnitude and
opposite sign. The exceptions are sales tax rates and workers compensation tax rates. For the
subject county sales taxes are strongly and negatively significant, but for the neighbor they are
insignificant. We see an equivalent note in the workers compensation figures in our F tests,
where for the neighboring county it appears to be significant, but not for the subject
county.<span class="footnote-mark"><a 
href="mscThesis_final15.html#fn14x0"><sup class="textsuperscript">14</sup></a></span><a 
 id="x1-19001f14"></a> 
However, given the rest of taxes pass this test, this finding might be a spurious result due to
the number of regressors.
<!--l. 266--><p class="indent" >   Table <a 
href="#x1-2201712">12<!--tex4ht:ref: --year --></a> shows regression results for each year between 1999 and 2009. We include state
controls but exclude geographic amenities. Property taxes remain consistently negative and
statistically significant over the time period. Likewise, sales tax rates remain negative
and statistically significant, with the effect becoming somewhat larger over time.
Income taxes are insignificant, but negative, at the beginning of the time period,
but become statistically significant and larger in the later years. Log highway and
welfare expenditures per capita are positive drivers of firm entry, but the effects
are inconsistently significant across the time periods and the magnitudes are very
                                                                                      
                                                                                      
small.
<!--l. 268--><p class="indent" >   Finally, Table <a 
href="#x1-2201813">13<!--tex4ht:ref: naics --></a> reports the estimates by NAICS sub codes, Agriculture, Fishing,
Forestry, and Hunting; Retail Trade; Manufacturing; and Finance and Insurance. These
results are very consistent with the results for all firms in Table <a 
href="#x1-220094">4<!--tex4ht:ref: --rd --></a>. We expected higher
property taxes to have a larger detrimental effect on agriculture services, and capital
gains taxes to have a higher impact on financial firm entry. However, this does not
seem to be the case. Property, income and sales taxes are significantly negative in all
specifications, and furthermore, the magnitudes are very similar across the industries. It may
be that our geographic scale, the county is too large to detect differences, as many
different types of firms are likely to enter a given county over the time period of our
study.
<!--l. 270--><p class="indent" >   Table <a 
href="#x1-2201510">10<!--tex4ht:ref: --metro --></a> provides an alternative look at this effect. We see that as we widen and narrow our
definition of urban, the effect of higher relative capital gains taxes remains positive and
significant, while income and sales taxes remain negative and significant. In contrast, in rural
areas, property taxes are the only tax rate with negative and significant effects. They seem to
solely drive the firm entry differential, to the point where the joint F-tests are rejected across
all model specifications. This property tax differential is consistent with regional
development theory that predicts that as manufacturing firms mature, they move to
rural areas to take advantage of lower property values (rents) and lower employee
wages.
<!--l. 272--><p class="indent" >   As a final output of our paper, we compare two different rankings to identify which borders
are most (or least) disadvantaged with regard to tax differentials. First we calculate the
weighted tax differential by multiplying the tax coefficients from Table <a 
href="#x1-220094">4<!--tex4ht:ref: --rd --></a>, column 4 by each
state&#8217;s marginal tax values. This estimates an expected value of the ratio of firm start up rates
                                                                                      
                                                                                      
driven by the tax differentials. These are plotted in Figure <a 
href="#x1-220008">8<!--tex4ht:ref: weightedtax --></a>. For most states, the weighted tax
differential is very small, thus the implied impact of taxes on relative firm start up rates is
ultimately small. However, for a few counties, this is not the case, and we see clear outliers
where more than a 1% difference in firm start up rates is motivated by the difference in tax
rates.
<!--l. 274--><p class="indent" >   To illustrate how important this effect is for firm entry we rank the county-pairs by the
absolute difference in the mean number of firm startups, and compare this to the
weighted tax differential. Table <a 
href="#x1-2202217">17<!--tex4ht:ref: meantable --></a> reports the top 10 largest mean differences in firm
start-ups. Since we calculate these terms in absolute value, we report which side
of the border has the advantage for firm startups in column 2 and which has the
advantage in terms for tax rate differences in column 4. Sixty-two percent of the time,
the side with the more advantageous weighted tax differential also has the higher
mean firm start up differential. We similarly rank the top 10 states by Weighted Tax
Differential in <a 
href="#x1-2202318">18<!--tex4ht:ref: taxtable --></a>. Compared to weighting by mean firm start up rate, there is a
higher correlation between having a higher weighted tax differential and mean firm
startups.

 id="x1-200007"></a>Conclusion</h3>
<!--l. 278--><p class="noindent" >This paper estimates the average impact of taxes on firm start up rates. Using a model that
relies on the similarity of locations on either side of a state border, we are able to effectively
control for location-specific determinants of firm entry in our empirical design, and
more precisely isolate the effects of policy that do vary on opposite sides of a state
border.
                                                                                      
                                                                                      
<!--l. 280--><p class="indent" >   We find that counties with higher property, income, and sales taxes relative to a
neighboring county in another state, have lower firm start-up rates. On average, a 1% increase
in the property tax differential decreases firm start up rates by 0.3%, while a 1% increase in
income and sales tax differentials decreases firm start up rates by 0.01%. These results are
generally consistent across industry groups, and time periods in our sample. They are also
largely robust to the addition of added controls.
<!--l. 282--><p class="indent" >   Our estimated model&#8217;s inability to find significant corporate and capital gains taxes follows
from characteristics of new firm entrants. Lacking firm-level characteristics, our model
approximates an average firm from the joint distribution of firm characteristics. However, most
new firms are small S corporations, meaning that owners pay top marginal income taxes
rather than corporate taxes, and firm employment and output is relatively low. Sales,
income, and property taxes may play a significantly larger role in their profits than
capital gains and corporate tax rates. Moreover, most new firms have a relatively
short life span, such that investments in the company will probably not be recouped,
and capital gains tax rates are not likely to impact the majority of small new firm
entrants.
<!--l. 284--><p class="indent" >   Government expenditure variables do not seem to impact firm start up rates. This might be
due to the fact that individuals can live in one county that has a preferred public expenditure
bundle and set up a business in a neighboring county that has a preferred regulatory
policy. Our robustness tests using Rohlin, Rosenthal, and Ross (2014) reciprocal
agreements mirror our main model and estimates, indicating that this impact is not
large.
<!--l. 286--><p class="indent" >   Based on our estimates, we calculate a weighted tax differential, showing that the impact of
taxes on firm entry rates remain small, only accounting for about 0.2% of the difference in firm
                                                                                      
                                                                                      
start up behavior across borders. Despite this, the side with the preferred taxation policy had
more firm startups 62% of the time in our sample. Therefore while taxes might have a small
impact at the margin, their adjustment may still be beneficial to communities and
states.
<!--l. 288--><p class="indent" >   Future work on this issue could benefit from more dis-aggregated, firm-level data with firm
specific characteristics. This would help establish better estimates of tax incidence on firm
startup and life cycle behavior. Our current estimates are limited by our set of covariates.
Lacking firm specific data, our estimates rely on a proxy &#8220;average firm&#8221;, which is most
likely small and not paying corporate taxes, nor have venture capital backing. Thus
taxes that may have impacts based on firm characteristics may be omitted from our
model.
