\title{Impacts of Taxes on Firm Entry Rates Along State Borders}
\author{Kevin D. Duncan}
\date{}
\maketitle

\begin{abstract}
This paper uses a regression discontinuity approach to estimate the impacts of taxes on firm entry rates between neighboring states. We utilize matched county pairs as an approximate bandwidth around the discontinuity in state policies imposed at their border. This controls for unobserved location specific determinants of firm entry, as well as policy responses to shocks shared across borders. We then estimate the impacts of property, income, sales, corporate, capital gains, workers compensation, and unemployment insurance top marginal tax rates on the differences in firm entry between counties. Our array of taxes controls for joint changes in tax policy that governments may implement to accomplish policy goals. We estimate this impact using a sample of 107 state-border pairs between 1999 and 2009. Our results indicate that property and sales taxes have the largest negative effect on firm start up rates, and in more recent year's income taxes as well.
