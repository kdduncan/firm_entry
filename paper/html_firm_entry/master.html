<!--l. 4--><p class="noindent" >This paper tests whether or not taxes impact firm entry rates between neighboring states.
Estimation of this marginal effect has been historically difficult. Tax and other policy
parameters tend to feature prolonged periods of stability, and changes may be endogenous to
many common dependent variables, such that changes in GDP, wages, and employment will
entice government officials to try and improve economic performance. This has led to time
series applications to use narrative approaches to try and identify the impacts of exogenous
shocks to tax rates on macroeconomic variables (Romer and Romer (2007), Mertens and Ravn
(2013)).
<!--l. 6--><p class="indent" >   We use a border-differencing technique to establish local estimates of the impacts of taxes
on firm entry rates. This method controls for endogeneity of government policy in response to
local economic outcomes. For example, high economic activity states may raise their taxes
knowing that local agglomeration factors will continue to attract an asymmetrically
high amount of new firm startups, while low economic activity states may lower
taxes to attract new businesses. This response would upwards-bias the estimate of
the impacts of taxes. Using the differences in firm entry rates along state borders
controls for local agglomeration factors, and treat differences in policy variables as
exogenous.
<!--l. 8--><p class="indent" >   This technique relies on the assumption that new firms pick entry locations within a local
choice set. Recent studies on agglomeration economies seem to support this view, where
Rosenthal and Strange (2003, 2005), and Arzaghi and Henderson (2008)) show that
entrepreneurs weight locations within a mile of them significantly higher than distances further
away. Use of border discontinuity designs started with Holmes (1998), though has quickly been
                                                                                      
                                                                                      
adopted by researchers looking to identify effects of policies across public economics,
including minimum wages (Dube et al (2008), Rohlin (2011)), welfare (McKinnish
(2005, 2007)), and school quality by Dhar and Ross (2012). It has even been used
by recent papers looking at the impacts of taxes on firm start up rates, including
Rathelot and Sillard (2008), Duranton et al (2011), and Rohlin, Rosenthal, and Ross
(2014).
<!--l. 10--><p class="indent" >   Our paper builds on a longer literature looking at determinants of firm entry. Early papers
such as Carlton (1979, 1983) and Schmenner (1975, 1982) failed to find incidence of taxes on
firm entry rates, instead finding that higher taxes could attract more firms. Starting
in the 80&#8217;s methods and data allowed for cleaner identification, such that authors
started to more definitively show that taxes had an impact on business activity,
including Wasylenko &amp; McGuire (1985), Bartick (1985), Papke (1991), and Hines
(1996).
<!--l. 12--><p class="indent" >   The literature studying the impacts of taxes on firm entry behavior has not settled on the
best variables to use for identifying the effects of taxes on firm start up rates. Carlton (1983)
used top marginal tax rates for corporate and income tax, but weighted them together, as well
as property tax rates. Schmenner (1987) uses state and local property tax revenues per dollar of
personal income. Helms (1985) used a budget constraint to estimate the impacts of rising tax
revenue on explanatory variables. All three versions have modern equivalents and the
literature has not settled on a single best practice to recover the proper marginal
effects.
<!--l. 14--><p class="indent" >   Theory indicates that marginal tax rates are what matter to individuals, and measures of
average tax burden change due to both fluctuations in wages or profits, as well as
to changes in tax rates. Using average tax rates may add endogeneity into models.
                                                                                      
                                                                                      
Also, politicians may alter multiple taxes at once in order to accomplish policy goals,
such that excluding taxes may imply omitted variable bias. Therefore, we argue that
using top marginal tax rates is the preferred method of estimating marginal effects of
taxes.
<!--l. 16--><p class="indent" >   We use a data set that includes property, income, corporate, capital gains, sales, workers
compensation, and unemployment insurance top marginal tax rates. We further add variables
for government expenditures, including highways, education, and welfare. This mirrors the
balanced budget approach of Helms (1985), Gabe and Bell (2004), and Ojede and Yamarik
(2012). Entrepreneurs sorting along by government expenditures would imply that increasing
tax rates to pay for certain services may not have negative effects on firm start up
rates.
<!--l. 18--><p class="indent" >   The paper proceeds in the following manner. First, we review literature relating to
estimating the determinants of firm entry. We then provide a model to show how utilizing
discontinuities along state borders allow researchers to control for location specific determinants
of firm entry. Next, we explain our empirical design, which uses matched county
pairs on either side of state borders to identify the effects on taxes on firm start up
rates. We then provide estimates of these impacts. We conclude by showing which
borders have the largest firm start up discrepancy, and talk about applications of our
work.

 id="x1-20002"></a>Literature Review</h3>
<!--l. 4--><p class="noindent" >Location choice of firms and individuals has a rich history in economics. At its core,
                                                                                      
                                                                                      
the question is what drives sorting behavior of firms into particular communities.
One of the earliest models to approach sorting behavior of individuals was Tiebout
(1956), who argued that individuals sorted into locations through preferences for
prices and public amenities. Tiebout posited that counties as a result of this
sorting behavior receive pressure on their provision of services in order to attract
individuals.<span class="footnote-mark"><a 
href="master2.html#fn1x0"><sup class="textsuperscript">1</sup></a></span><a 
 id="x1-2001f1"></a> 
<!--l. 6--><p class="indent" >   As a result Tiebout&#8217;s model, the early firm entry literature focused on sorting
over all available possible markets. These papers used conditional Logit models to
explain the probability of agents entering into particular markets. McFadden (1974)
showed a general framework on how to use conditional Logit function to estimate
firm entry sorting. Dowding, John, and Biggs (1994) review 200 articles and books
that there is evidence that taxes and services affect location decisions of firms and
households, and less assuredly, property values as is implied in the traditional Tiebout
models.
<!--l. 8--><p class="indent" >   Guimaraes, Figueirido, and Woodward (2003) showed that the conditional Logit models of
firm entry can be estimated by a Poisson distribution under relatively mild assumptions. Gabe
and Bell (2004) used Poisson and Negative Binomial regressions show how taxes and
government spending on education impact firm location in Maine. They recover the coefficient
on taxes by imposing a balanced budget requirement equivalent to Helms (1985). Their
results show that increasing tax rates to raise education spending per pupil causes
                                                                                      
                                                                                      
no distortion on firm entry rates. A review was on the differences between discrete
choice models and Poisson models was done by Arauzo-Carod et al (2010). They
show that as time has gone on, the discrete choice model has lost favor in favor of
count data models. In their review they show that agglomeration and market size
tend to have a significant positive effect, while wages and taxes act in the opposite
direction.
<!--l. 10--><p class="indent" >   Modern papers on firm entry paper have increasingly used border discontinuity methods. In
these models researchers test whether or not local discontinuities in policy induce firms or
individuals to change their start up or housing location. The first paper to use a matched
county-pair estimator is Holmes (1998). In Holmes&#8217; paper, he uses right to work status as a
proxy for an unobserved cost of being on either side of a state border imposed by &#8221;pro&#8221; and
&#8221;anti&#8221; business policies. He then tested whether or not right to work status affected
manufacturing employment growth. His estimates found that counties that have right to
work status attract more manufacturing firms than states without right to work
status.
<!--l. 12--><p class="indent" >   Since Holmes&#8217; work, authors have utilized this technique to test a variety of expanding
topics in public economics. A recent paper by Rohlin, Ross, and Rosenthal (2014) mirrors our
paper very closely. They estimate a linear probability model of firm entry using a border
difference estimator. They use GIS coded data to get a closer bandwidth to the border than our
method, and show that increasing the personal income tax differential actually increases the
likelihood of firms entering on one side of the border. However, they show that increasing the
corporate and sales tax differential can drastically reduce the relative firm entry
probability.
<!--l. 14--><p class="indent" >   Earlier work by Rohlin (2011) looked at the impact of minimum wages on firm start up
                                                                                      
                                                                                      
rates using less aggregated data. By utilizing the Dun and Bradstreet Marketplace data files
Rohlin constructed bands around state borders, and then derived estimates on the impact of
minimum wage changes on firm start up rates. He showed that increasing the minimum wage
decreased new establishment activity in industries that relied heavily on minimum wage
workers, but that changes in the minimum wage did not decrease employment in existing
establishments.
<!--l. 16--><p class="indent" >   Chirinko and Wilson (2008) use a border discontinuity technique to estimate the impacts of
state investment tax credits on firm start up rates. Rathelot and Sillard (2008) use the border
discontinuity technique in a Probit model to show that increasing the total tax rate differential
increases the probability of a firm picking a side between 1-5%. Duranton et al (2011) took the
difference in the firm entry rate in neighboring areas to estimate the impacts of taxes on
employment. They provide estimates both for traditional OLS estimates without the
difference, which estimated a positive relationship between taxes and firm entry rates,
but after applying the spatial difference, taxes negatively impacted firm start up
rates.
<!--l. 18--><p class="indent" >   From the literature, we see that on average taxes negatively impact firm start up rates,
especially as researchers have gone from studying sorting over all available entry choices, to
local choices along policy discontinuities. However, how taxes are calculated and used in
studies differs wildly among authors. Various studies have used measures of average
tax revenue, added together top marginal tax rates, or included a single available
tax rate. As a result, we employ more recent spatial difference techniques to get a
clear estimate, while employing a larger array of top marginal tax rates than other
authors.
                                                                                      
                                                                                      
   <h3 class="sectionHead"><span class="titlemark">3   </span> <a 
 id="x1-30003"></a>Theory</h3>
<!--l. 3--><p class="noindent" >As entrepreneurs and firms look to start up a business in a new location they first choose a
market to enter. This choice is due to primary considerations such as labor market
characteristics, or location preferences of the owner. They then pick among possible locations in
that market. Our model looks at choice of firm entry across state borders, such that individuals
have mobility across the border. As a result, firms treat location specific determinants of
profit as the same on both side of the border. This process leaves policy drivers as
remaining difference in expected profits. We formalize the conditions for this process
below.
<!--l. 5--><p class="indent" >   Assume there exists a spatial equilibrium where wages and capital costs are adjusted to
local tax and location specific variables affecting firm level productivity. If markets are
competitive firms will make zero economic profit in the long run, but in the short run demand
or policy shocks can leave short run profits. We expect that if a regime changes its taxes over
time, higher production costs and lower profits exist in that county, and that market will deter
a relative amount of firms from entering. Since firms will bid up or down prices relative to
taxes, those prices can be proxied by the tax rates directly. Firms make decisions
based on information from the previous year, as governments might concurrently
change policy along with market entry and there may exist costs to establishing a
business.

agglomeration figures, education attainment, and other variables driven by the distribution of
labor and productive factors in each regime. Variables at the regime level include taxes,

<!--l. 3--><p class="noindent" >Our main results are reported in Table (<a 
href="#x1-230052">2<!--tex4ht:ref: --rd --></a>). The first four columns respond to different pooled
OLS estimates where we include or exclude our set of control or amenity variables. The last two
columns report our fixed effect estimates. Our pooled OLS estimates show that the inclusion of
the geographic amenities makes property taxes lose statistical significance. However, the results
still economic intuition that most likely the impacts are small and negative across all of our
model estimates. Averaging across models would imply that a 1% increase in the relative
property tax difference would decrease firm start up rates by around 0.2%. The impacts of
income and sales tax differentials remain relatively stable across our OLS estimate, such
that a 1% increase in income tax differentials correspond to a 0.8$ decrease in the
relative firm start up rates, and similarly a 1% increase in sales tax differentials
corresponds to a 0.1% decrease in the relative firm start up rates. Even though capital
gains, corporate tax, workers compensation, and unemployment insurance tax rates
are individually insignificant, joint F-tests for all seven taxes show they are jointly
significant.
                                                                                      
                                                                                      
<!--l. 5--><p class="indent" >   We further see evidence that the difference in log welfare spending per capita is also
statistically significant, but the coefficient is economically very small, such that a 1% increase
in the difference corresponds to 0.001% higher firm entry rates. Finally, contrary our
assumptions, not all of our county level geographic amenities and state level controls become
zero at the border. The difference in log real fuel price remains positive and statistically
significant, and both the difference in Temperature in January and Log Area with Water
remain significant among the geographic controls.
<!--l. 7--><p class="indent" >   When we run models with state-pair level fixed effects we fail to obtain any statistically
significant results. However, the value of these models are dubious. We first argue that our
pooled OLS estimates are most likely the properly specified model as firm start up rates are an
already differenced estimate. Thus the inclusion of state pair fixed effect require year to year
divergence in expected profit from entry, which shouldn&#8217;t occur under perfect competition.
Rather this still might imply that there are still relevant variables we may be leaving out of our
model.
<!--l. 9--><p class="indent" >   Table <a 
href="#x1-230063">3<!--tex4ht:ref: --eb --></a> we estimate the extended bandwidth version of our model. We expect that the
longer distance between two locations will make taxes have a smaller impact on firm start up
rates, while traditional measures of state or local agglomeration economies will have a larger
impact. Consistent with this, we see that our tax rates become less individually statistically
significant across model types. Further, our state level controls remain largely insignificant, as
do our geographic controls. Thus, the fit of the model at large seems to decrease as the distance
between counties increases.
<!--l. 11--><p class="indent" >   When we run pooled OLS estimates where we do not impose that coefficients we see that
for most of our variables remain equal but opposite across the border. Table <a 
href="#x1-230074">4<!--tex4ht:ref: --noequality --></a> reports
coefficients, while Table <a 
href="#x1-230085">5<!--tex4ht:ref: --Ftests --></a> provides F tests for the assumption of the coefficients being the same

coefficients are the same and opposite in our design is a valid assumption. The exception is
sales tax rates and workers compensation tax rates, for the subject county they are strongly
and negatively significant, but for the neighbor they not significant at all. However, given
that the rest of them pass, this might be a spurious result due to the number of
regressors. We see an equivalent note in the workers compensation figures in our F tests,
where for the neighboring county it appears to be significant, but not for the subject
county.<span class="footnote-mark"><a

We use the model that includes state controls but excludes geographic amenities. We see that
property taxes remain consistently negative and statistically significant. Sales tax rates remain
negative and statistically significant, and even appears to grow in its deterrence of new
entry. Income taxes start off insignificant, but negative, and become statistically
significant from zero. Log highway and welfare expenditures per capita vary in their

Agriculture, Fishing, Forestry, and Hunting, Retail Trade, Manufacturing, and Finance and
                                                                                      
                                                                                      
Insurance. We find that our initial results in Table <a 
href="#x1-230052">2<!--tex4ht:ref: --rd --></a>, including magnitude and strength. This is
somewhat surprising, as we would expect characteristics that drive firm entry to differ across
firm types. Namely, property taxes may deter agriculture more than financial firms,
however it appears that the correlation between different firm types supersedes this
selection.
<!--l. 17--><p class="indent" >   As a final output of our paper, we compare two different rankings. First we calculate the
weighted tax differential by multiplying the tax coefficients from Table <a 
href="#x1-230052">2<!--tex4ht:ref: --rd --></a>, column 4 times each
states marginal tax values. These are plotted in Figure <a 
href="#x1-230008">8<!--tex4ht:ref: weightedtax --></a>. We see that for most states the
weighted tax differential is very small, thus the implied impact of taxes on relative firm start up
rates is ultimately small. However, for a few counties, this is not the case, and we see clear
outliers where more than 1% of the differential is motivated by the difference in tax
rates.
<!--l. 19--><p class="indent" >   To calculate how important this effect is still aggregately we provide a table of the
difference in the mean number of firm startups along each state border, as well as the weighted
tax differential. Since we calculate these terms in absolute value, we similarly show which side
of the border is preferred for the borders with the top 50 largest difference in mean firm
start ups. This ranking is provided in Table <a 
href="#x1-230118">8<!--tex4ht:ref: taxdifferential --></a>. We see that 62% of the time the side
with the preferred weighted tax differential also has the higher mean firm start up
differential.

 id="x1-210007"></a>Conclusion</h3>
<!--l. 3--><p class="noindent" >Our paper tests the impact of taxes on firm start up rates. We present a model illustrating that
when firm entry locations are close together and split across state borders, location specific
                                                                                      
                                                                                      
determinants of firm entry become insignificant. This allows researchers to estimate policy
effects. We estimate this model by taking the difference in county firm start up rates on
opposite sides of a state border. This allows us to examine firm entry behavior around state
borders by an approximate bandwidth.
<!--l. 5--><p class="indent" >   In our empirical results, we included property, income, corporate, capital gains, workers
compensation, and unemployment insurance top marginal tax rates. We further include
log expenditures per capital on education, highways, and welfare. We control for
state level agglomeration averages such as population density, fuel prices, union rate,
and percent of population with a high school degree, as well as and county level
geographic amenities, such as January temperature, July humidity, and log area with
water.
<!--l. 7--><p class="indent" >   Our estimated model shows that property, income, and sales taxes have the strongest
determining factor on firm start up rates. On average, a 1% increase in the difference in
property taxes decreases firm start up rates by 0.3%, while a 1% increase in income and sales
tax differentials decreases firm start up rates by 0.01%.
<!--l. 9--><p class="indent" >   The fact that corporate and capital gains taxes are not significant follows from
characteristics of new firm entrant. Generally many new firms are small S corporations,
meaning that owners pay top marginal income taxes rather than corporate taxes, and that
sales and property taxes may play a significantly larger role on their profits than
capital gains and corporate tax rates. Also, the average new firm has a relatively short
timeline, such that investments in the company will probably not be recouped, and
that capital gains tax rates are not likely to impact the majority of small new firm
entrants.
<!--l. 11--><p class="indent" >   In our sensitivity tests, we found that coefficients are the same across counties. We also
                                                                                      
                                                                                      
show that the sign, size, and significance of property and sales taxes remain consistent for each
time period in our sample, while income taxes gain significant over time. Finally, we show that
when we include an array of state-pair specific fixed effects all of our estimates become
insignificant, but our tax variables remain the largest, keeping their sign and relative
importance.
<!--l. 13--><p class="indent" >   Government expenditure variables do not seem to impact firm start up rates. This might be
due to the fact that individuals can live in one county that has a preferred public expenditure
bundle and still set up a businesses in a neighboring county that has a preferred regulatory
policy. Rohlin, Rosenthal, and Ross (2014) control for this by including reciprocal agreements
in their specification, which require workers to pay their income tax in the state of residence
rather than the state of employment. This may control for some of the sorting of entrepreneurs
we observe.
<!--l. 15--><p class="indent" >   We finally provided a weighted tax differential, showing that the impacts of taxes on firm
entry rates remain small, only accounting for about 0.2% of the difference in firm start up
behavior across borders. Despite this, the side with the preferred taxation policy had more
firm startups 62% of the time in our sample. Therefore while taxes might have a
marginally small impact, their adjustment may still be beneficial to communities and
states.
<!--l. 17--><p class="indent" >   Going forward obtaining firm specific characteristics will help establish better estimates of
tax incidence on firm start up and life cycle behavior. Generating county level agglomeration
figures and testing their impacts might also be a way of estimating the interior impacts of tax
differentials on firm start up rates. Finally, looking to test the welfare impacts of new firm
entrants is important. Current theory is agnostic about the impacts of firm entry
on welfare, and ensuring that policy changes improve lives required for program
                                                                                      
                                                                                      
efficacy.
