PLACEHOLDER, TO BE WRITTEN

This paper tests whether or not taxes impact firm entry rates along state borders. This topic has been researched extensively by economists over the years. Most studies, however, examine only one or two taxes when assesing impacts, but the levers of policy action extend across a large array of tax rates. As such, the effect of joint changes in tax policy is largely unanswered. In this study,  we include seven different taxes: property, income, corporate, capital gains, sales, workers compensation, and unemployment insurance top marginal tax rates.

The paper proceeds in the following manner. First, we review the literature on the determinants of firm entry. We then provide a model to show how utilizing discontinuities along state borders allows researchers to control for location specific determinants of firm entry. Next, we explain our empirical design, which uses matched county pairs on either side of state borders to identify the effects of taxes on firm start up rates. We then provide estimates of these impacts. We conclude by showing which borders have the largest firm start up discrepancy, and talk about applications of our work.
